Python implemented brand new file-based non-relational NoSQL database specification

## As stars and planets are spread out by the galaxy and galaxies by the Universe, your data can be stored in any place of your storage park.

**GalaxyDB is a generic specification for a NoSQL database system. For purposes of "making things happen" and prove concept is being build with Python, but the idea is that other languages implementations may emerge.**

That said, from now on, all subjects about implementation will be based in Python.

### Features

- Easy installation: just copy the sources to your projects and include modules as you need.
- The binary modelling makes it good for storing any type of data.
- Indirect access engine. Makes data gathering more efficient.
- Distributed data storage possibility based in developers configurations. (in course)
- Replicated data storage for redundancy. (in course)
- Dinamic size of records: no need to define the size of data you want to store. Forget about "VARCHAR(255)". Each data occupy the exact place it needs.
- Data type integrity: all data are stored and retrieve with the same type it is declared.
- Language based syntax. GalaxyDB don't define any query language. Just methods based on the Python syntax. Other languages implementations can do the same, making Galaxy databases talk one to other without need of any specific driver.
- Lock system for security of database in changes operations. (to do)

**I hope you can help the community to develop and evolve this software**

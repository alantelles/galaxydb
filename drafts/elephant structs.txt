Max pages = 2^2 bytes (65536 pages)
Max size of a page = 2^4 bytes (4294967296 bytes, 4GB)
Max size of a table = 65536 * 4294967296 = 256 TB

trash fields can be created when a record is moved
2 bytes   Vari       2 bytes   Vari

if the new value fit to the old the size is updated, else the register is moved and the field have the value field turn to TRASH
TRASH field are available to new records
